# Schematics

In this section, you will find the wiring diagram of how to connect the Photodiode and Status LED to the ESP board of your choice.

## Wiring diagram

Below you will find a wiring diagram of how everything is connected, depending on the type of board you use, the [GPIO pins](/docs/resources/gpio) may be in a different place. You could also omit the status LED if desired.

Please note that there are different boards in circulation and that the GPIO
pins may be on a different location than in the example above. So always double
check and, if necessary, consult the pin layout of your specific board.
