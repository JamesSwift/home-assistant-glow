# Adjust the Pulse Rate

The Glow uses a pulse meter to track energy usage, which requires setting the correct pulse rate to match your energy meter. This ensures accurate energy monitoring and tracking in Home Assistant.

In most cases, the correct pulse rate is set during the [getting started](/docs/getting-started#step-4-configure-the-pulse-rate) guide, but you can easily adjust it later if needed. If the pulse rate hasn't been changed yet, the Glow defaults to `1000` **imp/kWh**, which is commonly used in the Netherlands. However, you may need to modify this value based on your energy meter's specifications.

You can adjust the value in 2 ways:

### Option 1: Via the web interface

You open the web server by going to the IP address of your Home Assistant Glow, where you will find the line **Pulse rate - imp/kWh** in the table and you can then adjust it on the right.

</p>

### Option 2: In Home Assistant

1. Go to the device overview page of the Home Assistant Glow, via [**Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **ESPHome**](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integration/?domain=esphome).
2. Adjust the value for the entity **Pulse rate - imp/kWh**.
