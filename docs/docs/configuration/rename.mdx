# Rename your Glow in Home Assistant

When you add the Glow to Home Assistant, it is automatically given a default name like `home-assistant-glow-XXXXXX`, where `XXXXXX` is a portion of the device's MAC address. The reason for this naming convention is to ensure each device has a unique identifier, but it's not very user-friendly or descriptive.

## Why rename your device?

If you have multiple devices connected to Home Assistant, it can be challenging to remember which device is which. Renaming your device to something more descriptive can help you quickly identify it when setting up automations, creating dashboards, or troubleshooting issues.

## Step-by-step guide to renaming a device

Here's how to change the name of your device in Home Assistant:

1. Open your Home Assistant dashboard/interface.
2. **Go to settings**: From the main menu, click on **Settings** and then select **Devices & Services**.
3. Under the **ESPHome** section, find and select your device. If you have multiple devices, you may need to identify it by its current name (the default format described earlier).

  **Tip**: You can skip steps 1-3 by clicking the badge below to be taken directly to the ESPHome devices overview page.

4. Once on the device's details page, click the pencil icon at the top-right corner to begin renaming.
5. Enter your preferred name, something that reflects the purpose of the device (e.g., “Home Assistant Glow” or “Glow Energy”).
6. Click **Update** to apply the changes and save the new name.

### Renaming Entity IDs (Optional)

After renaming the device, Home Assistant may prompt you to rename the associated entity IDs as well. Entity IDs are used to reference your device in automations, dashboards, and other parts of Home Assistant.

- **If you haven't created any automations or dashboards yet**: It's generally a good idea to rename the entity IDs to match the new device name. This makes them easier to recognize and use in future configurations.
- **If you already have automations or dashboards**: You may want to keep the existing entity IDs if they are already used in various setups. Renaming the entity IDs will require you to update those configurations to reference the new names. In this case, you can opt to change only the device name and leave the entity IDs as they are.
